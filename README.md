Network analysis of political YouTubers from 2017-2018

This report seeks to analyze a network of political YouTubers (19 in total, randomly selected) and how their connections change from the year 2017 to 2018 by tracking the livestreams and videos (published) regarding debates and discussions between such YouTubers over the two-year period. An undirected graph was utilized in which the weights assigned to each edge were calculated as follows (same formula for both 2017 and 2018): 

Weight = Number of debates/discussions * Total Hours * Total Views * total Like/Dislike ratio

Where Total Hours is the sum of all hours of interactions in video, Total Views is the sum of all the views on the videos in which both YouTubers appear and total Like/Dislike ratio is the sum of all Like/Dislike ratios of each video in which the YouTubers interact for a particular year. Fig 1 shows the Network for the year 2017 and Fig 2 shows the network for the year 2018. In the network we observe that some YouTube channels have 1 (Vaush) or 0 (Dutton and Modern Day Debate) degrees, this is mainly because these channels had very little exposure and content during 2017 but in 2018 they experienced a significant rise in subscriptions and views, which allowed them to gain the attention of more influential and highly connected YouTubers (generally YouTuber collaborations are highly dependent upon the potential new subscribers, donations or channel views that will be acquired from inviting a guest on a particular stream).
